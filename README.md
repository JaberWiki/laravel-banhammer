Banhammer allows you to ban any Model by key and by IP. You also can just ban/unban IPs.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require mchev/banhammer
```

Then run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="banhammer-config"
```

It is possible to define the table name and the fallback_url in the `config/ban.php` file.

## Usage

To make a model bannable, add the `Mchev\Banhammer\Traits\Bannable` trait to the model:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Mchev\Banhammer\Traits\Bannable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Bannable;
}
```
> You can add the Bannable trait on as many models as you want (Team, Group, User, etc.).

### Ban / Unban

```php
// Simple ban
$user->ban();

// IP Ban
$user->ban([
	'ip' => $user->ip,
]);

// Full (all attributes are optional)
$user->ban([
	'created_by_type' => 'App\Models\User',
	'created_by_id' => 1,
	'comment' => "You've been evil",
	'ip' => "8.8.8.8",
	'expired_at' => Carbon::now()->addDays(7)
]);

// Shorthand
$user->banUntil('2 days');

// List user bans
$bans = $user->bans();

// Unban
$user->unban();
```

### IP

Manually ban IPs
```php
use Mchev\Banhammer\Banhammer;

Banhammer::ban(["8.8.8.8"]);
```

Manually unban IPs
```php
use Mchev\Banhammer\Banhammer;

Banhammer::unban(["8.8.8.8", "4.4.4.4"]);
```

List all banned IPs
```php
use Mchev\Banhammer\Banhammer;

$ips = Banhammer::bannedIps();
```

### Middleware
To prevent banned users from accessing certain parts of your application, simply add the `auth.banned` middleware on the concerned routes.
```php
Route::get('/profile', function () {
    // ...
})->middleware('auth.banned');
```

To prevent banned ips from accessing certain parts of your application, simply add the `ip.banned` middleware on the concerned routes.
```php
Route::get('/home', function () {
    // ...
})->middleware('ip.banned');
```

To block all, simply add the two middlewares:
```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    // ...
})->middleware(['ip.banned', 'auth.banned']);
```

### Scheduler

> âš  IMPORTANT

In order to be able to automatically delete expired bans, you must have a cron job set up on your server to run the Laravel Scheduled Jobs

> [Running the scheduler](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/scheduling#running-the-scheduler)

> [Configure Scheduler on Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/1.0/resources/scheduler.html#laravel-scheduled-jobs)

### Events

If entity is banned `Mchev\Banhammer\Events\ModelWasBanned` event is fired.

Is entity is unbanned `Mchev\Banhammer\Events\ModelWasUnbanned` event is fired.

### MISC

To permanently delete all the expired bans :
```php
use Mchev\Banhammer\Banhammer;

$ips = Banhammer::clear();
```

Or you can use the command:
```bash
php artisan banhammer:clear
```
